Proposed polymorphic Haskell2020 container for compiling statically linked binaries written in Haskell addressing Generics in Golang

Furthering the proposed Generic support for Go, this project is inspired by golang-builder and haskell-builder for Go.
This is for providing the same results for Haskell binaries.
