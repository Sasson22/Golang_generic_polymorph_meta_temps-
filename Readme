This is to address functional use of Generics and various templates for elegant adaptation in Golang.

Proposed for compiling statically linked binaries written in Haskell for libraries to compile to machine code. 

Furthering the proposed Generic support for Golang, this project is inspired by golang-builder and haskell-builder for Go.
This is for providing the same results for Haskell binaries.
